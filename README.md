# screamIRC

open source windows IRC bot. \
there's not really a whole lot of good windows IRC botnets out there, so I thought i would pull one together for myself. 
we looked through a ton of archvies and found some bot with the only feature of one exploit spreading.
here you go. 

Features:

1. load to one bot
2. load to all bots
3. get a list of other computers on the network

all bots have a randomly generated nickname prefaced by [WINDOWS]

will add more features
